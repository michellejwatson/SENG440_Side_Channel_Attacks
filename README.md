## RSA_Routine.c 
This file implements the montgomery modular multiplication algorithm pseudocode into c code. 
The value m can be changed to reflect the number of bits. 
Currently, the values of X, Y, M, and m are hardcoded. 
m is set to 32 bits but to check with the example in the slides change the value of m to 5.
